# Improving Rust/C++ Interop with Trivial Relocatability

The latest PDF for this paper is available
[here](https://camio.github.io/trivially_relocate_rust/trivially_relocate_rust.pdf).

## Building

This paper is written in typst and can be built with that tool. I recommend
using `typst watch trivially_relocate_rust.typ` and monitoring the output with
`evince` for interactive development.
